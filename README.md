### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm a **_DevOps Engineer_** who's been around the block a few times (4 years to be exact). 
Master of network, cloud, and infrastructure as code (IaC) - basically, if it's tech-related, I'm your man. 
Currently working on a Master's in Software Engineering, because you can never have too many degrees, right?

I've got mad skills when it comes to managing Linux and Windows servers, setting up SD-WAN networks, and keeping cybercriminals at bay with my firewall rules and traffic analysis. 
And let's just say, I was the IT manager at a secret government agency (shh!) where I helped lead teams to victory and delivered results like a boss.
