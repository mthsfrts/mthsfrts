### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm a **_DevOps Engineer_** who's been around the block a few times (4 years to be exact). 
Master of network, cloud, and infrastructure as code (IaC) - basically, if it's tech-related, I'm your man. 
Currently working on a Master's in Software Engineering, because you can never have too many degrees, right?

I've got mad skills when it comes to managing Linux and Windows servers, setting up SD-WAN networks, and keeping cybercriminals at bay with my firewall rules and traffic analysis. 
And let's just say, I was the IT manager at a secret government agency (shh!) where I helped lead teams to victory and delivered results like a boss.

Oh, and I'm also a Product Manager and Cloud Engineer. Basically, if it's tech-related and it needs to be done, I can do it. 
AWS instances? No problem. Cloud computing technologies? I got this.

So, if you're looking for someone who can make your tech dreams a reality, look no further. 
I'm your man (or woman, no judgement here).
